Linting and formatting the project

Note: pre-commit hooks are net yet installed and working in this repo. Until then, linting and formatting commands must be run manually.

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```


# TODO
* Install husky and lint-staged at the root directory of the project because this is a multipackage monorepo.
