# Games

1. Games can have minimum and max imum players when adding or editing the game. However, the min and max players need to be determined by a setting in the event.
2. Need to be able to specify the maximum desired play time per round.

 # Categories

 1. A Category cannot be removed if there are games attached to it. Or if the category is deleted, the game is not playable until it is put into a new category.
 2. We need to use category id to reference the category on the backend as to prevent random categories from appearing and causing errors.
